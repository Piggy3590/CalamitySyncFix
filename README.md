Have you ever encountered desync issues while playing Calamity?

This mod fixes some multiplayer desync issues in Calamity Mod, Like Fractured Ark, Galaxy Smasher.

NOTE: Synchronization involves sending a lot of packets. If there are a lot of projectiles being synchronized, this can overload the server! (I will add optimizations in the future to prevent this) and this is my first mod, so there may be issues.

TESTED ONLY ON Calamity 2.1.1!
